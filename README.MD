Code for the Software Engineering College Intern position Challenge. This code tries to retrieve n-items whose total value is greater than 95% of the value desired and less than 105% of the value desired, by solving a CSP.  DESCRIPTION: When giving gifts, consumers usually keep in mind two variables - cost and quantity. In order to facilitate better gift-giving on the Zappos website, the Software Engineering team would like to test a simple application that allows a user to submit two inputs: N (desired # of products) and X (desired dollar amount). The application should take both inputs and leverage the Zappos API (http://developer.zappos.com/docs/api-documentation) to create a list of Zappos products whose combined values match as closely as possible to X dollars. For example, if a user entered 3 (# of products) and $150, the application would print combinations of 3 product items whose total value is closest to $150.?
